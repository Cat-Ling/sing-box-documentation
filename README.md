# Sing-Box Documentation Scraper

A Go-based tool that dynamically fetches and consolidates all sing-box configuration documentation into a single markdown file.
Useful for keeping AIs up-to-date on the documentation when asking questions, migration and even new config generation.

The script will fetch the current version of all documentation pages and regenerate `DOCUMENTATION.md`.
